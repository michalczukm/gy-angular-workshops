## Exercises:
1. I added Notes array `notes` and bind it to app.component.html view. Add `selectedNote`, set it to **first array element** and bind it to view.
2. You saw how to use `*ngIf` - use it to add extra `<h5>` header to list element which is selected.
3. We've added `ngForm` and `ngSubmit`, but still nothing changed. Add `newNote` to list, but remember - it also needs created date!
4. Add missing `date` pipes.
5. Adding components - finally! Same as I had extracted `NoteDetailsComponent` please create `NotesListComponent`. Hmm, what about `selectItem` method?
